      <h2>Filipino-Style Chicken Adobo</h2>
      <img src="adobo.jpg" alt="" height="250px">
        <p>The Philippines was a colony of Spain for over 3 centuries. Most of their dishes have Spanish influences, adobo being one of them.
        “Adobo” was derived from the Spanish word “adobar” which means to marinade.
        The Philippine adobo has browned chicken cooked in soy sauce and vinegar and seasoned with garlic and peppercorns. The marinade gives the chicken a savory flavor with just a hint of acidity. The sauce thickens into a golden glaze as it cooks, which is what makes the dish perfect with steamed rice.

      <h2>Dinuguan</h2>
      <img src="dinuguan.jpg" alt="" height="250px">
         <p>This dish might put you off once you find out what it’s made of, but it’s so good you have to give it a chance.
      The word “dinuguan” means “cooked with blood.” The dish is black because the sauce is primarily made with pig’s blood.
      Diced pork cooked in blood, vinegar, and spices, this dish is wonderfully rich and savory. Paired with puto – a sweet rice cake, dinuguan is the perfect afternoon snack.

      <h2>Beef Pares</h2>
      <img src="pares.jpg" alt="" height="250px">
        <p>Beef pares is ultra-tender beef cooked in a sweet and savory broth. And when I say tender, I’m talking melt-in-your-mouth tender! 
        The brisket is marinated in brown sugar and soy sauce, giving it such a wonderful sweet and savory flavor. Apart from beef, the broth is also absolutely to die for. With a special blend of spices and seasonings, don’t be surprised to find yourself slurping it from the bowl.
        Fun fact: Pares is Filipino for “pair,” and is called such because the dish is best paired with rice.

      <h2>Lumpiang Shanghai</h2>
      <img src="lumpia.jpg" alt="" height="250px">
        <p>Lumpiang Shanghai is a Filipino favorite inspired by the Chinese.
          Ground meat mixed with carrots and onions stuffed in egg roll wrappers and deep-fried until golden: that’s what Lumpiang Shanghai is all about.
          A word of caution: these rolls are insanely addictive! Limiting yourself to three pieces is a real challenge.
          Dipped in either ketchup or a sweet and sour sauce, Lumpiang Shanghai is the ultimate party finger food.

      <img src="aroz.jpg" alt="" height="250px">
        <p>Arroz caldo is a rice porridge filled with chicken, scallions, toasted garlic, and a hard-boiled egg. Think of it is as the Filipino congee.
          Known as the ultimate comfort food, it’s the Filipinos’ go-to dish on a cold, rainy day.
          The broth is flavored with ginger, among other spices and seasonings, making it so cozy and comforting.

      <h2>Monggo Guisado</h2>
      <img src="munggo.jpg" alt="" height="250px">
        <p>Monggo guisado is a thick, umami-packed bean stew made from mung beans.
          The beans are soaked in water for several hours to make them tender and thus easier to cook. 
          The beans are then sauteed in garlic and onions and simmered until melt-in-your-mouth tender. The result is a ridiculously rich and flavorful dish!
